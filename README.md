# Eclipse Discord Integration

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KazeJiyu/eclipse-discord-integration.svg?branch=master)]

## Motivation

Implement a plug-in for Eclipse IDE that uses Discord's [Rich Presence](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence) in order to display current work within Discord's overlay.

## Work in Progress

**Disclaimer**: The work is still in progress and the plug-in is not available yet.
