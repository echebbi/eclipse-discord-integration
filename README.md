## Presentation

Discord Rich Presence for Eclipse IDE is a plug-in that uses [Rich Presence](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence) in order to display information related to your current work in Discord.

Here is an example of the Rich Presence Integration:

</div>

> **!** Please [take a look at the Wiki](https://github.com/echebbi/eclipse-discord-integration/wiki) for further information about installation, use and customizations.

## Installation

### From the update site
The plug-in can be installed from the following update site:

- [https://dl.bintray.com/kazejiyu/eclipse-discord-integration/updates/](https://dl.bintray.com/kazejiyu/eclipse-discord-integration/updates/)

To use it from Eclipse IDE, click on `Help` > `Install new software...` and then paste the above URL.

### From the Eclipse Marketplace

The plug-in is also available in the [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/discord-rich-presence-eclipse-ide).

Drag the following button to your running Eclipse workspace to start the installation:
<div align="center">
  <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=4240174" class="drag" title="Drag to your running Eclipse* workspace. *Requires Eclipse Marketplace Client"><img typeof="foaf:Image" class="img-responsive" src="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/sites/all/themes/solstice/public/images/marketplace/btn-install.png" alt="Drag to your running Eclipse* workspace. *Requires Eclipse Marketplace Client" /></a>
</div>

## Troubleshooting

### Discord does not detect Eclipse IDE as a game

If Discord is not showing anything, ensure that Eclipse IDE is detected as a game. To this end, open Discord `User Settings` then go the `Games` tab. Click on the `Add it!` button and then select Eclipse IDE.

### A 'Workbench early startup error' occurs since the plug-in is installed

In case you encounter the following error on startup:
```
An internal error occurred during: "Workbench early startup".

There is an incompatible JNA native library installed on this system
Expected: 5.1.0
Found: 4.0.1
```
you can try to modify the _eclipse.ini_ file which is located next to _eclipse.exe_ in order to set the `jna.nosys` property to true as follows:
```
-vmargs
-Djna.nosys=true
```

> The `-vmargs` line should already exist, otherwise you can append it at the end of the file.

## Deactivate Discord Rich Presence

Once the plug-in is installed, Discord Rich Presence is automatically started on Eclipse startup. As a result, Discord displays **Playing Eclipse IDE** as a status message as soon as Eclipse IDE is opened. This behavior may not be desirable but can be easily deactivated.

1. Open Eclipse Preferences (`Window` > `Preferences`)
2. Open the plug-in's page (`Discord Rich Presence`)
3. Uncheck _Activate Rich Presence Integration_
4. Click on _Apply_

From that time on, Discord won't be notified anymore by Eclipse IDE. In order to re-activate Rich Presence, follow the steps above and check _Activate Rich Presence Integration_ again.
